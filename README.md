# GDSC2524

**Google Developer Student Clubs 2524 (GDSC2524)** is a website that enables residents of a city to report illegal dumping, clogged storm drains, potholes, or other issues to their city. GDSC2524 makes it easier for city departments to quickly identify and act on issues affecting their residents. This project can be easily extended depending on student interests and career interests. Students have the opportunity to explore or specialize in design, frontends, backends, databases, or infrastructure. Stretch goals could include data visualization and dashboarding, authentication and authorization, integration testing, and API design and data modeling.
